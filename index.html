        <p>Hello! My name is Darian Sanders. I am from Birmingham, Alabama. I am a fourth-year Computer Science major at Berea College currently. I am the middle child of five kids. This is my first website, which I am very proud of! Right now, my web site does not look great, but I am hoping to improve my design as I learn more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
